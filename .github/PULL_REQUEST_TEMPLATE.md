# Code Review Checklist

- [ ] No out commented code
- [ ] Good variable & method names
- [ ] Code located in the right file/folder/package
- [ ] No redundant or `//TODO` comments
- [ ] Cannot be simplified
- [ ] Right abstraction level
- [ ] Modular enough
- [ ] No code duplication
- [ ] Cannot think of any inputs or events that could break the code

Question:

- Are there any parts that are the slightest bit confusing and why?
  - Rather ask a question that is too small than to not ask any question
